# AND-Udemy-Upskilling

A collection of projects completed through Udemy courses available through AND's Udemy licenses

The motivation behind this repo is to complete course available through AND's Udemy licenses. The goal is to complete the courses and upload the projects to this repo. Each course will the have a README file, containing the following:

- Course Name / Author
- Time Taken To Complete
- Tech upskilled
- Why I chose this course
- What I learned
- Would I recommend this course

This repo will be continually updated as I complete more courses, and is public for those at AND to see what I've been up to. I also hope that this repo will
be useful to other ANDis who are looking to upskill, and to AND to determine if there is value in continuing to purchase Udemy licenses.

At the point of writing this, I am a level 2.1 Associate Developer and i'm familiarising myself with best coding practices and design patterns.
