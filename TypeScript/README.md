# - Why I chose this course
I chose this course as TypeScript is becoming an increasingly popular language, and one that would help me to become a better developer.
Becoming more proficient in TypeScript would also help me to become more proficient in JavaScript, as TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript,
and helps me to learn how I use TypeScript with React and in back-end development.
